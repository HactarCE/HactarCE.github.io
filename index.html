				This website is inspired by Z80 Heaven, a place for all the Z80 info you'll want, but I found that although much of the same information applied to the eZ80 processor, it was still different enough that many of their tutorials and instruction set pages weren't accurate on the eZ80. This website is partially to spare others' eyes from the Zilog eZ80 manual, and partially to teach myself, as the best way to learn something is to teach it. This website will be composed mostly of reference pages, but may eventually also have some tutorials further down the road.
